# Computer Vision Research & Design Competition

## Overview
This competition invites researchers and professionals to create a comprehensive system design for a computer vision application. The aim is to develop a design that meets the application requirements, with clear justifications and a structured breakdown, enabling fresh graduates to implement and test the system. This competition emphasizes practical, real-world computer vision solutions that are feasible for implementation in hardware, software, and firmware domains.

Participants will be expected to:
1. Conduct research and create a design fulfilling the specified application requirements.
2. Provide a strong justification for why their proposed design meets these requirements.
3. Break down the high-level system design into actionable tasks suitable for fresh graduates from software, hardware, and firmware branches.
4. Develop a comprehensive testing and validation plan that competing students can follow for their RTL testbenches and software validation.

## Objectives
1. **Application-Focused Design**: Create a research-backed design for a computer vision application that addresses specified application requirements.
2. **Justification**: Provide a well-supported explanation for how and why this design meets the requirements.
3. **Educational Task Breakdown**: Break down the design into structured tasks that fresh graduates in software, hardware, and firmware can understand and implement.
4. **Testing and Validation Plan**: Develop a robust testing and validation plan to guide implementation and ensure quality.

## Contest Entry Requirements

Each entry should include the following components:

### 1. Research & Design Proposal
- **Research**: Conduct in-depth research on computer vision techniques and applications that align with the competitionâ€™s objectives.
- **Design Proposal**: Submit a high-level design proposal detailing the overall architecture, key components, and their roles.
- **Justification**: Provide a well-documented justification for how the proposed design meets the application requirements.

### 2. System Breakdown
- **Task Breakdown**: Decompose the design into manageable tasks, providing clarity and direction for fresh graduates in software, hardware, and firmware.
- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation of the tasks, including diagrams, explanations, and expected outcomes.

### 3. Testing & Validation
- **Testing Plan**: Outline a comprehensive testing plan that specifies testing protocols for different components.
- **Validation Plan**: Define validation criteria and methods to ensure that the design meets application requirements.
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Provide guidelines for RTL testbench development and software tests, enabling fresh graduates to verify their implementations against specified benchmarks.

## Judging Criteria
- **Application Relevance**: How effectively the design addresses the specified computer vision application requirements.
- **Justification Quality**: The depth and clarity of the justification provided for the design.
- **Clarity of Breakdown**: The clarity and accessibility of the task breakdown for fresh graduates.
- **Testing & Validation Rigor**: The robustness and clarity of the testing and validation plan.

## Submission Guidelines
- **Format**: All submissions must be in Markdown format with supporting diagrams as PNG or SVG.
- **Repository**: Participants should submit their work through GitHub by creating a pull request in the competition repository.
- **Deadline**: [Insert Deadline Date]
