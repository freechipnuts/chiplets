# Chiplets AI SoC Competition

## Overview
The **Chiplets AI SoC Competition** challenges researchers and professionals to design a comprehensive **AI System on Chip (SoC)** optimized for **computer vision applications**. The competition consists of four phases, beginning with **Requirements & Architecture Design**, followed by **Implementation and RTL Design**, **Verification and Validation**, and culminating in **Synthesis, Place & Route (P&R), and Tape-Out**.

In Phase I, participants are expected to define the application requirements themselves, developing a research-backed blueprint that aligns with real-world AI SoC needs in computer vision. The design should be feasible across hardware, software, and firmware domains and enable recent graduates to implement and test the system effectively.

### Considerations for Phase I Design

In Phase I, participants need to consider the following elements while designing their system:

- **Verilog and C-Model**: Include Verilog top module definitions with signals, interfaces, and a detailed C-model down to the protocol level.
- **Compiler, Linux Drivers, and Software Stack**: The solution should come with Linux drivers, test benches, kernel- and user-mode software, and C header files with corresponding C APIs for full integration.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Provide development tools and support for **OpenGL** where relevant, leveraging existing drivers where possible.

To guide the design, participants can explore resources such as:
- [Broadcom SoC Documentation](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/12358545)
- [Mesa Panfrost Open Source GPU Driver](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/panfrost.html)
- [NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA)](https://nvdla.org/hw/v1/hwarch.html)
- [VeriGPU GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hughperkins/VeriGPU)

Additionally, participants are encouraged to examine open-source implementations like AMD‚Äôs **Southern Islands ISA** for insights into GPU ISA and **Panfrost** for ARM Mali Midgard GPUs, which leverage a rich ARM software ecosystem.

## Phase I: Requirements
Participants are expected to:
1. **Define application requirements**: Conduct research and propose requirements that align with the demands of a computer vision-focused SoC.
2. **Justify the proposed requirements and design**: Present clear, research-backed reasoning for chosen requirements and how the design meets them.
3. **Break down the system architecture**: Provide a structured approach that fresh graduates in hardware, software, and firmware can follow.
4. **Develop a testing and validation plan**: Create a plan to ensure accuracy and robustness for both RTL and software validation.

## Objectives
1. **Application-Focused Design**: Define and design around a realistic computer vision application.
2. **Justification**: Present a rationale for the requirements and design decisions.
3. **Educational Task Breakdown**: Structure the design into tasks manageable for recent graduates.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Establish a framework for testing and validation.

## Contest Entry Requirements
Each submission should encompass:

### 1. Research & Design Proposal
- **Research**: Conduct comprehensive research on SoC design, focusing on computer vision and AI applications.
- **Design Proposal**: Outline the overall architecture, defining key components, interfaces, and roles.
- **Justification**: Present a clear justification for design choices and architecture, emphasizing compatibility and scalability.

### 2. System Breakdown
- **Task Decomposition**: Break down the design into actionable tasks for software, hardware, and firmware, with documentation including diagrams, explanations, and expected outcomes.
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed task documentation, complete with Verilog and C headers, facilitating understanding and implementation.

### 3. Testing & Validation
- **Testing Protocols**: Develop test protocols for each component, using protocol-level testbenches for RTL validation.
- **Validation Guidelines**: Set forth clear criteria for validation, ensuring the design meets application requirements and is suitable for deployment.

## Judging Criteria
- **Application Relevance**: How effectively the design addresses the participant-defined requirements.
- **Justification Quality**: The clarity and depth of the rationale for design decisions.
- **Task Clarity**: Accessibility of the task breakdown for fresh graduates.
- **Testing & Validation Rigor**: Robustness and clarity of the testing and validation framework.

## Submission Guidelines
- **Format**: Submissions must be in Markdown format, with supporting diagrams in PNG or SVG.
- **Repository**: Submit via GitHub by creating a pull request in the competition repository.
- **Deadline**: [Insert Deadline Date]
